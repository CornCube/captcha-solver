# captcha-solver

a project that breaks Google ReCaptchas (currently a WIP)

### HOW TO USE
make sure that the latest chromedriver is installed, then run main() to test.

### Details
there are 4 main types of recaptcha that may be encountered. I have labeled them as types 1-4 in my code.
- type 1 = 16 grouped squares, need to select each square that has a part of the bounding box in it
- type 2 = 16 grouped squares, same as type 1, but may also have to press 'skip' if nothing is detected.
- type 3 = 9 individual images, simply need to select the right ones and hit verify
- type 4 = 9 individual images, but need to keep solving as long as new images that meet the requirement are detected

to solve, the program follows the following steps: 
1. initialize chrome and pretrained yolov5 model on the COCO dataset
2. pull the instructions from the header and classifies the challenge by object and type
3. takes a screenshot of the entire image grid and runs yolov5 on it
4. presses on tiles that contain the corresponding object
5. takes another screenshot if the challenge calls for multiple runs, or hits verify if not.

### Limitations
- model is not always accurate, leading to incorrect tile presses
- couldn't figure out an algorithm to press all tiles that contain a bounding box in types 1 and 2
- captchas get progressively harder to solve as failed attempts accumulate on the ip
- the COCO dataset doesn't contain a couple of objects that captchas may ask about - mountains, hills, and crosswalks for example
